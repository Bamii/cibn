                <p>
                  A central feature of the chequered history of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria has been the sustained struggle to enthrone professional excellence in the banking industry in Nigeria. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  This struggle, based essentially on the need to jealously guard, preserve and positively project on the noble profession of banking, which is based on the principle of “Trust and Honesty”, has not been easy considering the numerous problems associated with a developing banking industry and the Nigerian economy in general.
